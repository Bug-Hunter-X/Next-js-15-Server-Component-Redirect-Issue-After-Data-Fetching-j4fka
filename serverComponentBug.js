In Next.js 15, using the `app` directory and server components, I encountered an issue where data fetching within a server component wasn't properly handling redirects.  Specifically, if my server component fetched data and then needed to redirect based on that data (e.g., checking for authentication), the redirect wouldn't work as expected.  The client-side would receive the data, but the redirect would be ignored.
